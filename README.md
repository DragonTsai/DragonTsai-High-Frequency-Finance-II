This repository contains my second coursework for the High-Frequency Finance course, focusing on the exploration and implementation of foreign exchange (FX) trading strategies based on the intrinsic time framework. The key methodology employed is the "Dissection Algorithm," which identifies directional changes in FX price data.

**Key Contents and Features:**

* Introduction to the Dissection Algorithm: A detailed explanation of the algorithm's principles and its application in the FX market.
* Implementation of Trading Strategies:
  Strategy 1: Decision-making based on fixed thresholds.
  Strategy 2: Incorporates the Overshoot Value (OSV) to dynamically adjust stop-loss and take-profit levels.
* Strategy Testing: Backtesting the strategies using historical data for EURGBP and EURUSD to evaluate performance under various threshold settings.
* Results and Analysis: Analysis of the performance of both strategies under different market conditions and suggestions for strategy optimizations based on empirical data.
